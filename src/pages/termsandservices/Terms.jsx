If the Operator profile believes that any particular Customer's review violates any of the Flying Chital' policies, the operator profile may write to us at <strong>  <a href="mailto:neutrality@FlyingChital.com"></a> </strong> <span className="text-blue-600 underline font-normal" >neutrality@FlyingChital.com</span>
